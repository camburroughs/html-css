        <li>1 cup low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup spicy buffalo sauce</li>
        <li>2 oz cream cheese (or Neufchâtel cheese for a lower-fat option)</li>
        <li>1 cup fat-free shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>5 protein tortilla wraps</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 Tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F</li>
        <li>While the oven is heating, prep chicken by mixing the cumin, garlic, salt, pepper and paprika. Generously coat 
            chicken and place on a parchment-paper lined baking tray. When the oven is ready, place chicken on middle rack 
            for 15-20min or until reaching an internal temp of 165°F. Remove and let rest.
        </li>
        <li>While chicken is baking, combine cottage cheese, cream cheese, and buffalo chicken sauce in a blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>After chicken cools, dice into small pieces, or about 1/2" cubes.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine chicken, buffalo cheese sauce, and the fat-free mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Finally, evenly distribute chicken mixture between the 5 torillas and wrap. To store, cover each wrap in foil and place in fridge.</li>
    </ol>
